      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p> Mace Windu, a Power touchy human male, was a respected Jedi
          Ace and individual from the Jedi High Board amid the most recent years
          of the Galactic Republic. Amid his opportunity in the Jedi Request, he
          once filled in as chose pioneer of the Jedi and, amid the Clone
          Wars, as a Jedi General in the Great Armed force of the Republic. He was
          the best champion of the Jedi Request and advanced its old
          customs in the midst of the developing impact of the dull side of the
          Power in the degenerate, declining days of the Republic.
      </p>
      <p>At the point when the Nonconformist Emergency brought forth the introduction of the Alliance of
        Free Frameworks and started the Clone Wars, Windu and the Jedi
        revived to the barrier of the Republic and turned into the pioneers of the
        Excellent Armed force of the Republic. All through the war, Windu served the Jedi
        furthermore, the Republic in different limits—on the front line in summon of
        the clone armed force, on Coruscant as a regulator of the war exertion and an
        counsel to Incomparable Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, and even as a negotiator
        to challenged universes, regardless of his despise of governmental issues. His endeavors on
        the forefront filled in as an indication of his notoriety for being a famous Jedi
        warrior.
      </p>
      <p>As the war attracted to a nearby, Windu turned out to be progressively suspicious of the
        chancellor's intentions, as Palpatine had amassed close tyrannical control over
        the Galactic Senate, and detected the rising energy of the dull side in the
        cosmic system. His doubts were affirmed when Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight
        furthermore, the Divinely selected individual of antiquated prescience, found that Palpatine was Darth
        Sidious, the Dim Ruler of the Sith who controlled the Republic and the
        Rebel Organization together into war. Windu, alongside Jedi Experts Pack Fisto, Agen
        Kolar, and Saesee Tiin, stood up to Palpatine with the expectation of capturing
        him. Rather, the Dim Master assaulted them, striking them down one by one until
        just Windu was cleared out. Windu bested Palpatine in the showdown and—choosing
        he was too hazardous to be in any way left alive—arranged to strike him down, however the
        mediation of Anakin Skywalker, who spared the chancellor's life, prompted
        Windu's demise.
      </p>
      <p>Windu's activities driven Palpatine to mark the Jedi as deceivers to the Republic.
        The chancellor executed Request 66, and clone troopers over the system turned
        against and slaughtered their Jedi pioneers, denoting the fall of the Jedi Request.
        Palpatine changed the Republic into the Galactic Realm, and the Sovereign's
        new administration advanced hostile to Jedi opinion over the system. Through purposeful publicity
        the Realm depicted Windu as the pioneer of a criminal posse of Jedi who caused
        the flare-up of the Clone Wars. Regardless of the purposeful publicity, some of Windu's
        activities were recalled with affection; General Cham Syndulla, who served
        close by Windu amid the Clash of Ryloth, recollected Windu with extraordinary
        regard and told the story of how Windu helped him free Ryloth amid the
        war.
